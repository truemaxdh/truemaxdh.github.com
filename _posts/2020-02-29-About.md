description : As a programmer, I had been used mostly C/C++ and C#. But nowadays I also use Java/Spring and Javascript, because I am maintenancing a public site. So I am paying much attention to UI and front-end skills. And for this purpose, I have been done some private projects, mostly in HTML/javascript. This site is a sort of my coding log, that is to say, traces of my private projects. It is written in HTML/javascript, and some are C/C++. And some other language may be used in the future.
