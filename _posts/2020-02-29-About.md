title: About
description : As a programmer, I had been used mostly C/C++ and C#. But these days I also use Java/Spring and Javascript, because I am doing maintenance work on a public sites. So I am paying much attention to UI and front-end skills. And for this purpose, I have been done some personal projects mainly with HTML/javascript. This site is a sort of my coding log, i.e. traces of my personal projects. It is written in HTML/javascript and some are C/C++. And some other language may be used in the future.
