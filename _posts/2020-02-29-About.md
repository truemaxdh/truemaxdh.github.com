<h3>About</h3>
<hr>
<p class="detail">
  As a programmer, I had been used mostly C/C++ and C#. 
  But nowadays I also use Java/Spring and Javascript, 
  because I am maintenancing a public site.
  So I am paying much attention to UI and front-end skills.
  And for this purpose, I have been done some private projects,
  mostly in HTML/javascript.
  
  This site is a sort of my coding log,
  that is to say, traces of my private projects.
  It is written in HTML/javascript, 
  and some are C/C++.
  And some other language may be used in the future.
